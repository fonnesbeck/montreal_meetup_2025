# From Data to Decisions Under Uncertainty: Modern Bayesian Computing with PyMC 

Traditional machine learning models excel at making predictions but often fall short when quantifying uncertainty—a critical requirement for high-stakes decisions in production systems. This talk introduces PyMC, a probabilistic programming framework for Python, demonstrating how modern Bayesian methods can enhance your ML toolkit with built-in uncertainty quantification and interpretable results. We'll begin by demystifying Bayesian computation through live coding examples, showing how PyMC makes it as easy to code probabilistic models as writing them on a whiteboard. Once specified, models can be compiled to a high-performance back end like JAX or Numba, and fit using one of several modern inference methods. I will cover key features like PyMC's coords and dims system that prevents dimensionality bugs, `pymc.Data` containers for production model updates, and functions `pymc.do()` and `pymc.observe()` for facilitating causal inference workflows. You'll learn the complete Bayesian workflow—from prior specification through model validation—with emphasis on practical implementation over mathematical theory.
